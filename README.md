## Overview
  
During the Wasserstoff Assignment, this project lasted 96 hours. Using the technology I've acquired up to this point and being comfortable with feature documentation were project goals.

## Requirements

# There are few points that I have taken care of during building this project
- All layout and structure should explanatory names.
- All the CSS className are self explanatory.
- Folder structure should be followed properly.
- Minimal use of Inline CSS.
- Only installed necessary packages and remove unnecessary packages.
- `Not used any image` for implementation of the project.
- Last and very important tried to give proper comments to every Section possible.

## Challenges Faced

- One of the main problems I had was finding the right dataSet because the team hadn't given us any. It was challenging to find one that was globally accessible and would match the Figma template's design specifications.

- It was a little difficult for me to code some of the design elements within the allotted time. Thus, after doing some study, I utilized the ant-design library for plots and the react-simple-map library for the "map" to address it.


## Approach
- First I have completed the folder structure so I can work on predecided path and deleted unnecessary files and folder (created during create-react-app).

- Define the components required for the app, including Navbar, Footer, Sidebar, WorldMap, BarChart, OverView, Dashboard, Analytices, and Home.

- Implement the functionality for each component and its corresponding route(s) using React and any other libraries or tools as needed.

- Use the Routes and Route components from react-router-dom to define the routes for the app, and render the appropriate component for each route.

- Add any necessary styling and layout to the app using a CSS file "Style.SCSS" .

- After that i thought about how to implement graphs like Bar chart , bubble chart and scatter charts i had read about on how how to implement and apply on my project so i done using ApexChart library,react charts and i implemented the bubble chart using JSX and SASS 

- Test the app to ensure that it is working as expected and meets all of the requirements.
Deploy the app to a hosting service or platform as needed.

- Continuously maintain and improve the app as required, including fixing bugs, adding new features, and optimizing performance.

to host this project we are using netlify.

- So, now you are having all the basic and important info of the project. I hope you will like my project, I know i can do better than this but have tried my best to implement all the feature and functionalities according to the template in this tight time boundation.
